## Running this project

1. Install packages (I use `yarn` for package management):

```sh
yarn
```

2. Run the dev server:

```sh
yarn dev
```

To run a production build, first we need to build the app:

```sh
yarn build
```

Then run the app in production mode:

```sh
yarn start
```

## The Challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the game depending on their device's screen size
- Play Rock, Paper, Scissors against the computer
- Maintain the state of the score after refreshing the browser _(optional)_
- **Bonus**: Play Rock, Paper, Scissors, Lizard, Spock against the computer _(optional)_
